I gave a talk on "Machines" and stream processing in [Haskell](https://github.com/ekmett/machines) and [Scala](https://github.com/runarorama/scala-machines), to the [Brisbane Functional Programming Group](http://www.bfpg.org/) at Microsoft HQ in December 2012. A lot of people have asked me for the slides, so here they are:

The preÃ«mptive answer to the usual follow-up question is that the talk was not recorded.

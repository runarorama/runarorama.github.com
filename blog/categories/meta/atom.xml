    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have not seriously updated the <a href="http://apocalisp.wordpress.com">old Apocalisp blog</a> for quite some time. Mostly this is due to the fact that I have been spending all of my creative time outside of work on <a href="http://manning.com/bjarnason">writing a book</a>. It&rsquo;s also partly that putting a post up on WordPress is a chore. It&rsquo;s like building a ship in a bottle.</p>

<p>So I have decided to make posting really easy for myself by hosting the blog <a href="http://github.com/runarorama/runarorama.github.com">on GitHub</a>. I am using a dead-simple markdown-based framework called <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. With this setup I can very easily write a new post from my command line and publish by pushing to GitHub. This is already part of my normal coding workflow, so it feels more friction-free.</p>

<p>The new blog is simply titled &ldquo;Higher Order&rdquo;, and is available at <a href="http://blog.higher-order.com">blog.higher-order.com</a>. Check back soon for posts that I&rsquo;ve been sitting on but have been too <del>lazy</del> busy to post.</p>

<p>All of the old content and comments will still be available at the old address, and I&rsquo;ll probably cross-post to both places for a little while.</p>
